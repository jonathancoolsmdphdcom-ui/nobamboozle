Innovative sarcoma therapy using multifaceted nano-PROTAC-induced EZH2 degradation and immunity enhancement.

Sarcomas are highly malignant tumors characterized by their heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapies, which significantly limit treatment options. EZH2 is highly expressed in sarcomas, but targeting it is difficult. In this study, we uncovered the non-canonical transcriptional mechanisms of EZH2 in sarcoma and highlighted the essential role of EZH2 in regulating YAP1 through non-canonical transcriptional pathways in the progression of sarcoma. Building on this, we developed YM@VBM, a novel and versatile nano-PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera), by integrating a polyphenol-vanadium oxide system with the EZH2 degrader YM281 PROTAC, encapsulated in methoxy polyethylene glycol-NH
