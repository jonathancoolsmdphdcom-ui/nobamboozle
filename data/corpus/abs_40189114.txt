Tertiary lymphoid structures achieve 'cold' to 'hot' transition by remodeling the cold tumor microenvironment.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in immune-infiltrated tumors such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, "cold tumors"-including ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gliomas-exhibit insufficient immune infiltration, leading to poor therapeutic responses to ICBs and limited improvement in patient prognosis. Recent studies have shown that tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) can induce strong local immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME), serving as important biological markers for predicting ICB therapy efficacy. Notably, preclinical and clinical studies on cold tumors have confirmed that TLSs can potently enhance ICB efficacy through TME remodeling-a breakthrough that has attracted considerable attention. Here, we systematically examine the immunological profile of cold tumors and decipher the mechanistic basis for their impaired immune cell infiltration. We further delineate the distinctive features of tumor-associated TLSs in generating antitumor immunity and establish criteria for their identification. Significantly, we emphasize the unique capability of TLSs to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment characteristic of cold tumors. Based on these insights, we evaluate clinical evidence supporting TLS-mediated enhancement of ICB efficacy and discuss emerging strategies for exogenous TLSs induction.
