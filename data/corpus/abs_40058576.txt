Artery tertiary lymphoid organs in atherosclerosis: A review.

Atherosclerosis (AS) is the common pathological basis for many cardiovascular diseases. Initial investigations into AS predominantly centered on endothelial immune responses associated with plaque formation. However, recent studies increasingly underscore the salutary immune modulation occurring on the aorta adventitia as the atheromatous plaque progresses. The immune responses extend from the intima of the vessel to the adventitia, and the artery tertiary lymphoid organ (ATLO) assumes a major immune role in advanced stages of AS, according to available studies conducted on ApoE
