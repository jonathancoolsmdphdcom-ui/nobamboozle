Intratumoral CXCL13

Stage IV gastric cancer is a highly heterogeneous and lethal tumor with few therapeutic strategies. The combination of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors and chemotherapy is currently the standard frontline treatment regimen for advanced gastric cancer. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to screen the beneficiaries of immunochemotherapy and expand indications for this treatment regimen. We conducted a pathological assessment to ascertain the importance of tertiary lymphoid structures based on the tissue samples collected from patients with stage IV gastric cancer (n=15) both prior to and following immunochemotherapy treatment. Additionally, we used spatial (n=10) and single-cell transcriptional analysis (n=97) to investigate the key regulators of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Multiplex immunofluorescence and image analysis (n=34) were performed to explore the association between tumor-infiltrating CXCL13 We found that responders exhibited higher levels of TLSs and CXCL13 The number and maturity of TLSs, along with the extent of CXCL13
