Prognostic and therapeutic potential of gene profiles related to tertiary lymphoid structures in colorectal cancer.

The role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in oncology is gaining interest, particularly in colorectal carcinoma, yet a thorough analysis remains elusive. This study pioneered a novel TLS quantification system for prognostic and therapeutic response prediction in colorectal carcinoma, alongside a comprehensive depiction of the TLS landscape. Utilizing single-cell sequencing, we established a TLS score within the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME). Analysis of tertiary lymphoid structure-related genes (TLSRGs) in 1,184 patients with colon adenocarcinoma/rectum adenocarcinoma (COADREAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases led to the identification of two distinct molecular subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) further segregated these patients into gene subtypes. A TLS score was formulated using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and its efficacy in predicting immunotherapy outcomes was validated in two independent cohorts. High-scoring patients exhibited a 'hot' immune phenotype, correlating with enhanced immunotherapy efficacy. Key genes in our model, including
