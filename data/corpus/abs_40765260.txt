Prognostic Impact of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM588) in Combination With Pembrolizumab for Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Combining the probiotic product CBM588 with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown improved prognosis in several cancers. Pembrolizumab alone as a second-line treatment for urothelial cancer (UC) extends prognosis by only 3 months. This is a retrospective study that examined the effects of CBM588 combined with pembrolizumab in advanced UC. The study included 44 patients who had recurrence or progression after first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin. The study compared 33 patients treated with pembrolizumab alone and 11 patients treated with CBM588 plus pembrolizumab over a median observation period of 12 months. The combination of CBM588 and pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.004) and overall survival (OS; p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identified CBM588 as a significant prognostic factor for both PFS (hazard ratio: 0.074, p = 0.0008) and OS (hazard ratio: 0.105, p = 0.0056). These results suggest the effectiveness of the CBM588 combination with ICI treatment in UC.
