The impact of metabolic reprogramming on tertiary lymphoid structure formation: enhancing cancer immunotherapy.

Cancer immunotherapy has achieved unprecedented success in the field of cancer therapy. However, its potential is constrained by a low therapeutic response rate. Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) plays a crucial role in antitumor immunity and is associated with a good prognosis. Metabolic reprogramming, as a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, can influence tumor immunity and promote the formation of follicular helper T cells and germinal centers. However, many current studies focus on the correlation between metabolism and TLS formation factors, and there is insufficient direct evidence to suggest that metabolism drives TLS formation. This review provided a comprehensive summary of the relationship between metabolism and TLS formation, highlighting glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and vitamin metabolism. In the future, an in-depth exploration of how metabolism affects cell interactions and the role of microorganisms in TLS will significantly advance our understanding of metabolism-enhanced antitumor immunity.
