Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Microorganism-Related Cancer.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are ectopic lymphoid tissues formed by the accumulation of lymphocytes and other components outside lymphoid organs. They have been shown to be widespread in cancers and have predictive effects on prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy; however, there is no standardized measurement guide. This paper provides a reference for future research. Moreover, the induction strategy for the formation mechanism of TLSs is a new direction for future cancer treatment, such as cancer vaccines for microorganisms. The effects of microorganisms on cancer are dual. The role of microorganisms, including bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi, in promoting cancer has been widely confirmed. However, the specific mechanism of their tumor suppressor effect, particularly the promotion of TLS formation, is currently unknown. In this review, we summarize the role of TLSs in cancer related to microbial infection and provide new ideas for further understanding their mechanisms of action in cancer.
