Serous Ovarian Carcinoma: Detailed Analysis of Clinico-Pathological Characteristics as Prognostic Factors.

Serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC) is the most common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, with high-grade (HGSOC) and low-grade (LGSOC) subtypes presenting distinct clinical behaviours. This study aimed to evaluate histopathologic features in SOC, correlating these with prognostic outcomes, and explore the potential clinical implications. We analysed 51 SOC cases for lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), tumour border configuration (TBC), microvessel density (MVD), tumour budding (TB), the tumour-stroma ratio (TSR), the stromal type, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). A validation cohort of 54 SOC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used for comparison. In the discovery set, significant predictors of aggressive behaviour included LVSI, high MVD, high TB, and low TILs. These findings were validated in the validation set where the absence of TLSs, lower peritumoural TILs, immature stromal type, and low TSR were associated with worse survival outcomes. The stromal type was identified as an independent prognostic predictor in SOC across both datasets. Inter-observer variability analysis demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement for these features, ensuring the reproducibility of the findings. The histopathological evaluation of immune and stromal features, such as TILs, TLSs, TB, TSR, and stromal type, provides critical prognostic information for SOC. Incorporating these markers into routine pathological assessments could enhance risk stratification and guide treatment, offering practical utility, particularly in low-resource settings when molecular testing is not feasible.
