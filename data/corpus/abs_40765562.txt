Single-Gene Mutations in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Applications and Challenges in Precision Medicine.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a genetically heterogeneous malignancy in which single-gene mutations serve as critical drivers of tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Advances in high-throughput genomics and liquid biopsy technologies have highlighted the clinical utility of mutations in genes such as TP53, CTNNB1, and TERT as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. These mutations disrupt key oncogenic pathways, modulate the tumor immune microenvironment, and contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity, complicating disease management. Mutation-guided precision medicine, including telomerase inhibitors, Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway modulators, and immune checkpoint blockade, offers promising avenues for individualized treatment in HCC. However, challenges persist in translating these findings into clinical practice due to mutation complexity, resistance mechanisms, and limitations in biomarker standardization. Emerging strategies such as multi-omics integration, artificial intelligence, and gene editing technologies hold potential to overcome these barriers and facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic regimens. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms, clinical applications, and translational challenges of single-gene mutations in HCC, with the aim of guiding future research and precision oncology.
