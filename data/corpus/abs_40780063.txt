Advances in the management of lung & gastro-intestinal cancers: clinical studies review from ASCO 2022/2023 annual meetings.

Advancements in cancer research play a pivotal role in enhancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convenes major annual meetings, gathering experts worldwide to discuss the latest discoveries and trends in the field. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive bibliographic analysis of ASCO presentations and publications from 2022 to 2023 to identify dominant themes in cancer research. Our research methodology involved targeted searches in bibliographic databases and ASCO meeting archives, utilizing specific keywords related to various cancer types. Subsequently, we rigorously selected studies based on predefined criteria, with a particular focus on lung and gastrointestinal cancers due to their prevalence and significant public health impact. Among notable studies, evaluations of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced gastrointestinal cancers revealed promising response rates, while precision medicine approaches showed significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Studies like PARADIGM and PRODIGE demonstrated the efficacy of novel therapeutic combinations, while the NEO-PAN trial explored new avenues in locally advanced pancreatic cancer treatment. Additionally, novel therapeutic options such as Mobocertinib and sotorasib were identified as offering new hope for patients with specific lung cancers. Studies KEYNOTE-799 and SKYSCRAPER also demonstrated significant survival improvements in patients with stomach, esophageal, and non-small cell lung cancers. Furthermore, the PROTECT study underscored the crucial importance of efforts to reduce severe chemotherapy-related side effects, potentially enhancing patients' quality of life. These findings highlight the significance of ASCO meetings as a vital source of information and collaboration in the fight against cancer, providing valuable insights for the clinical management of this complex disease.
