Prognostic value of tertiary lymphoid structures in triple-negative breast cancer: integrated analysis with the tumor microenvironment and clinicopathological features.

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most immunogenic breast cancer type, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an independent prognostic factor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are an important TILs source, but they are not integrated in the current prognostic criteria. In this retrospective study, TLS were assessed in hematein-eosin-saffron-stained (HES) histological sections from 397 early, chemotherapy-naive TNBC samples after primary surgical resection. Their association with i) classical clinicopathological features, ii) TILs and CD3+, CD8+, CD20+ lymphoid populations, iii) CD68+, CD163+, CD11b+, CD66b+ myeloid populations, and iv) expression of the PD1/PD-L1 and PVR/TIGIT axis immune checkpoint components and their prognostic significance were evaluated. TLS were observed in 88.2% of samples, mainly in peritumoral areas (86.1%). Increased amount of peritumoral TLS (PT-TLS) was significantly associated with younger age (p<0.001), smaller tumor size and higher tumor grade (both, p<0.001), HER2 Our results suggest that TLS are a frequent feature in early TNBC and that their presence, particularly at the tumor periphery, recapitulates the tumor immune microenvironment. In our series, their prognostic value outperformed that of TILs. Therefore, their easy quantification on routine HES sections and their integration into the factors classically analyzed by pathologists could improve the clinical management of TNBC, a breast cancer type whose prognosis remains too poor.
