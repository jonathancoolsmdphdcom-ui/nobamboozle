Differential expression pattern of CC chemokine receptor 7 guides precision treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) faces challenges of low response rates to targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are influenced by complicated microenvironment of HCC. In this study, the complex tumor microenvironment was identified by using tissue microarray (TMA), spatial transcriptomes and single-cell sequencing. High expression of CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) in tumor cells predicted lower Overall Survival (OS). Conversely, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of CCR7 enhanced the sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib in preclinical experiments, resulting from the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. Simultaneously, we revealed CCR7 expression in stromal cells, with increased infiltration of CCR7
