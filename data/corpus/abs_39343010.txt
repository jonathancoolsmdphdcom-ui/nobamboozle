Lymphocyte Function in Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Predicts Hepatocellular Carcinoma Outcome.

An increasing number of studies have revealed a correlation between tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the associations between the heterogeneity of cellular composition and the overall survival (OS) in HCC remain unexplored. Here, we evaluated the cancer tissues from 150 HCC individuals using multiplex immunofluorescence to determine the presence and characteristics of TLS and to investigate the relationship between intra-TLS immunologic activity, TLS maturation, and intratumoral immune cell infiltration. Prognostic factors influencing the outcome were identified through both univariate and multivariate analyses. Additionally, the levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death 1, programmed death-ligand 1, and lymphocyte activation gene-3 were determined, as well as their relationship with TLS features were determined. TLS was detected in 71 (47.3%) of the 150 HCC cases and was related to higher intratumoral infiltration levels of lymphocytes. Additionally, intra-TLS lymphocyte proliferation correlated with that of intratumoral lymphocytes, and the presence of TLS and a high proportion of mature TLS demonstrated a significant correlation with better prognosis (P = .013 and P = .03, respectively). Among TLS-positive tumors, a high proportion of B cells expressing activation-induced cytidine deaminase and a high proportion of CD8
