Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization with or without programmed death-1 inhibitors in the treatment of intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization with or without programmed death-1 inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) in the treatment of intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were searched for studies comparing lenvatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization with PD-1 inhibitors (TACE-L-P) versus Lenvatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE-L) for intermediate or advanced HCC. Meta-analyses were conducted for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (Grade ≥ 3 AEs). The meta-analysis comprised 19 retrospective cohort studies, including of 2002 patients diagnosed with intermediate or advanced HCC. In this cohort, 1011 individuals were administered TACE-L-P, while 991 patients received TACE-L. In comparison to TACE-L, TACE-L-P demonstrated a superior ORR [odds ratio (OR) = 2.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 ~ 2.87, P < 0.00001] and DCR (OR = 3.22, 95% CI, 2.32 ~ 4.45, P < 0.00001). TACE-L-P showed superior efficacy compared to TACE-L regarding PFS (HR: 0.56, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.62, P<0.0001) and OS (HR: 0.70, 95%CI 0.60 to 0.80, P<0.0001). Regarding safety, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was more prevalent in the TACE-L-P group compared to the TACE-L group (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.27 ~ 1.97, P<0.0001). The present meta-analysis present a comparison of the efficacy and safety of TACE-L-P against TACE-L for intermediate or advanced HCC. TACE-L-P enhanced ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS relative to TACE-L. Furthermore, the improved efficacy of TACE-L-P was correlated with a rise in the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024590414, identifier CRD42024590414.
