PD-L1 expression and immune infiltration across molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer: An integrative-analysis of molecular classification and immune subtypes.

The immune subtypes of the tumor microenvironment in endometrial cancer (EC), associated with different molecular classifications, warrant further investigation to guide EC immunotherapy strategies. This study focused on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (Clone SP263) and immune cell (IC) markers (CD3, CD8, CD68, CD20, CD21) in 110Â EC cases. In this cohort, the molecular subtype distribution was: POLE mutation (POLEmut) 7.3% (8/110), mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) 21.8% (24/110), p53 abnormal (p53abn) 14.5% (16/110), and non-specific molecular profile (NSMP) 56.4% (62/110). NSMP subtypes exhibited the lowest PD-L1+ cell densities and scores. POLEmut and MMRd subtypes showed higher IC densities, while p53abn and NSMP subtypes had lower IC densities and fewer tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS).
