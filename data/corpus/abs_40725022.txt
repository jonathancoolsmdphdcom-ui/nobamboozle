Tumor Microenvironment in Melanoma-Characteristic and Clinical Implications.

Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence worldwide, highlighting the need for research into its pathogenesis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in melanoma progression and consists of cellular components and an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in cytokines and signaling molecules. The most abundant stromal cells within the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which remodel the ECM and modulate immune responses. Among immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominate, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype supports tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have diverse functions, including cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells that modulate immune response, B-cells forming tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and regulatory T-cells with immunosuppressive properties. Dendritic cells (DCs) also play a complex role in the TME. A notable subpopulation are mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), which contribute to immune evasion. All of these TME components may drive tumorigenesis. Advancements in melanoma treatment-including immunotherapy and targeted therapies-have significantly improved outcomes in advanced-stage disease. In parallel, emerging approaches targeting the tumor microenvironment and gut microbiome, as well as personalized strategies such as neoantigen vaccines and cell-based therapies, are under active investigation and may further enhance therapeutic efficacy in the near future.
