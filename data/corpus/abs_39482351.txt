Revealing molecular mechanisms of early-onset tongue cancer by spatial transcriptomics.

Tongue cancer at a young age demonstrates an increase in incidence, aggressiveness, and poor response to therapy. Classic etiological factors for head and neck tumors such as tobacco, alcohol, and human papillomavirus are not related to early-onset tongue cancer. Mechanisms of development and progression of this cancer remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatial whole-transcriptome profiling of tongue cancer in young adults compared with older patients. Nine patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma (T2-3N0-1M0) were included and divided into two groups: younger (n = 5) and older than 45 years (n = 4). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh frozen (FF) samples of tumor tissue from 4 young and 5 older patients, respectively, were used for spatial transcriptomic profiling using the 10 × Genomics Visium. The findings were validated using SeekGene single cell full-length RNA sequencing (1 young vs 1 older patient) and TCGA data (15 young vs 70 older patients). As a result, we performed the first successful integration of spatial transcriptomics data from FF and FFPE samples and revealed distinctive features of tongue cancer in young adults. Oxidative stress, vascular mimicry, and MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways were enriched in early-onset tongue cancer. Tumor microenvironment demonstrated increased gene signatures corresponding to myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and plasma cells. The invasive front was accompanied by vascular mimicry with arrangement of tumor-associated macrophages and aggregations of plasma cells and lymphocytes organized into tertiary lymphoid structures. Taken together, these results indicate that early-onset tongue cancer has distinct transcriptomic features and molecular mechanisms compared to older patients.
