Powerful microscopy technologies decode spatially organized cellular networks that drive response to immunotherapy in humans.

In tumors, immune cells organize into networks of different sizes and composition, including complex tertiary lymphoid structures and recently identified networks centered around the chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and CCL19. New commercially available highly multiplexed microscopy using cyclical RNA in situ hybridization and antibody-based approaches have the potential to establish the organization of the immune response in human tissue and serve as a foundation for future immunology research.
