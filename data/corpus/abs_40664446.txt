Review: radiotherapy-mediated B cells within the TLS influence the tumor microenvironment.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a diverse and intricate structure consisting of tumor cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells. It is characterized by the communication between tumor cells and both innate and adaptive immune cells. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are temporary abnormal collections of lymphoid tissues in which specialized immune responses against tumors can occur. B cells are crucial for the prognostic prediction of various cancers, particularly in response to immunotherapy. There are many types of B cells within the TME, including naive, terminally differentiated plasma, and memory B cells. Our focus was to understand the various types of B cells and how radiation therapy influences B cells in TLS. In this review, we discuss the notion that radiotherapy may alter the creation and function of B cells in TLS, which could result in a powerful and advanced form of cancer immunity.
