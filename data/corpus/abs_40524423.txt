Editorial: New Target for Skin Cancer.

Skin cancer encompasses a diverse spectrum of malignancies with increasing global incidence and persistent clinical challenges. Despite advances in therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents, many patients-especially those with rare subtypes or immunologically 'cold' tumours-face limited options and poor outcomes. This special issue of Experimental Dermatology, titled 'New Target for Skin Cancer', highlights 29 original articles that reflect the evolving landscape of dermatologic oncology. The collection spans six key themes: molecular and genetic mechanisms, tumour microenvironment and immunology, novel diagnostic biomarkers, emerging therapeutic strategies, rare cancer subtypes and technological innovations. Studies presented include identification of small nucleolar RNAs and metabolic pathways as prognostic markers, analysis of tertiary lymphoid structures and the use of spatial omics and artificial intelligence for diagnostic refinement. Promising therapeutic strategies discussed involve antibody-drug conjugates, oncolytic viruses and stromal-targeting agents. Several articles focus on underrepresented cancers such as extramammary Paget's disease and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, underscoring the need for more inclusive research. Technological advances such as exÂ vivo functional drug screening and mobile health platforms are also explored as tools to personalise and expand access to care. Collectively, these contributions illustrate how interdisciplinary integration of molecular biology, immunology, engineering and AI is reshaping both research and clinical practice in skin cancer. This issue serves as both a comprehensive update on current progress and a forward-looking roadmap for future innovations aimed at improving patient outcomes across all skin cancer types.
