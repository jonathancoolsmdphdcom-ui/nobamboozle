Unravelling the difference of immune microenvironment characteristics between esophageal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma and conventional esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Esophageal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (basaloid ESCC) is an uncommon variant of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We characterized the tumor immune microenvironment features of basaloid ESCC, and compared them with conventional ESCC. One hundred and four basaloid ESCC patients and 55 conventional ESCC patients were included in Cohort 1. Among 104 basaloid ESCC, 81 were pure basaloid ESCC, and 23 were mixed basaloid ESCC with invasive basaloid ESCC components and ESCC components. In pure basaloid ESCC, there were more immature desmoplastic reaction (P < 0.001), fewer peritumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) (P < 0.001), and lower tumor proportional score (TPS) and combined positive score (CPS) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004) than in conventional ESCC. In mixed basaloid ESCC, the number of mature or intermediate desmoplastic reaction (P < 0.001), the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) score (P = 0.043), the proportion of stromal CD8 Our data indicated that basaloid ESCC had less benefits from immunotherapy than conventional ESCC, and manifested as immune "cold" with immature-type desmoplastic reaction, lower TILs, lower peritumoral TLSs, and lower PD-L1 expression than conventional ESCC.
