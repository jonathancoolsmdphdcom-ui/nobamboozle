ACAT1 regulates tertiary lymphoid structures and correlates with immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are emerging solid-tumor indicators of prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Considering that tumorigenesis requires metabolic reprogramming and subsequent TME remodeling, the discovery of TLS metabolic regulators is expected to produce immunotherapeutic targets. To identify such metabolic regulators, we constructed a metabolism-focused sgRNA library and performed an in vivo CRISPR screening in an orthotopic lung tumor mouse model. Combined with The Cancer Genome Atlas database analysis of TLS-related metabolic hub genes, we found that the loss of Acat1 in tumor cells sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 treatment, accompanied by increased TLS in the TME. Mechanistic studies revealed that ACAT1 resulted in mitochondrial protein hypersuccinylation in lung tumor cells and subsequently enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which impeded TLS formation. Elimination of ROS by NAC or Acat1 knockdown promoted B cell aggregation and TLS construction. Consistently, data from tissue microassays of 305 patients with lung cancer showed that TLS were more abundant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues with lower ACAT1 expression. Intratumoral ACAT1 expression was associated with poor immunotherapy outcomes in patients with NSCLC. In conclusion, our results identified ACAT1 as a metabolic regulator of TLS and a promising immunotherapeutic target in NSCLC.
