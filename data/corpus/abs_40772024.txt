Incidence of thyroid adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with baseline positive thyroid antibodies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

To systematically evaluate the incidence of thyroid adverse events in patients with baseline positive thyroid antibodies following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we utilized PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies that detail the thyroid immune-related adverse events (irAEs) among cancer patients undergoing treatment with ICIs. Literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 16.0 software, with adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A total of 13 studies involving 2,059 patients treated with ICIs for malignancies were included, with 594 cases of thyroid irAEs reported post-treatment. Meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of thyroid irAEs in patients with baseline positive thyroid antibodies was 66.7% (95% CI: 45.1%, 85.5%; Z=7.825,  Patients with baseline positive thyroid antibodies experience a higher incidence of thyroid irAEs following ICI treatment. In comparison to TPOAb, baseline TgAb positivity showed a non-significant trend toward higher thyroid irAE risk (based on limited studies), but further evidence is needed to confirm this relationship. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42025635209.
