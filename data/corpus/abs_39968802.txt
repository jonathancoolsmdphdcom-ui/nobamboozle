Unraveling Novel Subsets of Lymphocytes Involved in Sac Expansion in the Tertiary Lymphoid Structure Within an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.

Chronic inflammation is involved in the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) within vascular lesions has recently been focused on for its role in modulation of inflammation in local tissues. We aimed to elucidate the relationships between TLS and pathophysiology of AAA. Abdominal aortic samples obtained from 37 patients with AAA (men/women: 34/3, age: 72.8±9.9 years) and 15 autopsied patients who died from non-aortic events (men/women: 11/4, age: 65.5±9.8 years) were investigated. TLSs in AAA lesions were confirmed by focal infiltration of CD3-positive cells surrounding germinal center-like structures containing CD20-positive cells between the tunica adventitia and tunica media layers. The formation of a TLS was significantly more prevalent in AAA patients than in autopsied patients. The number of TLSs in AAA lesions was positively correlated with sac diameter (r=0.357,  The formation of a TLS in AAA lesions is associated with sac diameter and intraluminal thrombosis in connection with interfollicular T follicular helper cells and double negative B cells, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of AAA and might be novel therapeutic targets for the development of AAA.
