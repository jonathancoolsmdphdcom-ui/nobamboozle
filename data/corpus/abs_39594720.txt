Tumor-Infiltrating B Cells and Tissue-Resident Memory T Cells as Prognostic Indicators in Brain Metastases Derived from Gastrointestinal Cancers.

Tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) play significant roles in antitumor immunity. However, their prognostic relevance in brain metastases (BMs) derived from gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of TIBs and TRMs in GI cancer-derived BMs (GIBMs). Retrospective histopathological analyses were performed on surgically resected GIBM tissues from 13 patients. The densities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) subsets (TIBs, CD4 TIBs and CD4 TIB and TRM densities in BM tissues could serve as reliable prognostic indicators for survival in patients with GIBMs. This study provides crucial insights for the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies against this lethal disease.
