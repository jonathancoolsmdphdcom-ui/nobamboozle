Use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer in elderly patients: a meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized clinical trials.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is prevalent and often diagnosed at advanced stages. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathways have transformed treatment, yet elderly patients remain underrepresented in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with placebo and/or chemotherapy in elderly patients with NSCLC. Overall survival (OS), Event-Free Survival (EFS) and OS for large studies were evaluated. Random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals were applied. Twelve RCTs with 3078 patients were included. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improved OS (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.69-0.84; p < 0.001) and EFS (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.54-0.83; p < 0.001). Large studies showed consistent benefit. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improve clinical outcomes in elderly NSCLC patients compared to standard treatments.
