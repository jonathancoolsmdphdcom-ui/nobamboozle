Tissue-resident immune cells in cervical cancer: emerging roles and therapeutic implications.

The favorable prognosis of "hot" tumors is widely acknowledged in oncology. Recently, the concept of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) has renewed appreciation for local immune cells within tumor tissues. Tissue-resident immune cells, a newly identified subset of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, are emerging as potential key players in tumor infiltration and TLS formation, due to their ability to reside indefinitely within tissues and mount effective responses to local antigens. Cervical cancer (CC), the fourth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally, has experienced comparatively limited progress in delineating its tumor immune microenvironment compared to other malignancies. Notably, the role of tissue-resident immune cells within the CC milieu remains inadequately characterized. This comprehensive review aims to synthesize current knowledge and critically evaluate the putative roles of these cells in CC pathogenesis, providing new insights on the intricate dynamics of the local tumor microenvironment.
