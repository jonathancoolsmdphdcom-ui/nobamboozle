Immune Cell Densities Predict Response to Immune Checkpoint-Blockade in Head and Neck Cancer.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is the standard of care for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), yet efficacy remains low. The current approach for predicting the likelihood of response to ICB is a single proportional biomarker (PD-L1) expressed in immune and tumor cells (Combined Positive Score, CPS) without differentiation by cell type, potentially explaining its limited predictive value. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS) have shown a stronger association with ICB response than PD-L1. However, their exact composition, size, and spatial biology in HNSCC remain understudied. A detailed understanding of TLS is required for future use as a clinically applicable predictive biomarker. Pre-ICB tumor tissue sections were obtained from 9 responders (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 11 non-responders (progressive disease) classified via RECISTv1.1. A custom multi-immunofluorescence (mIF) staining assay was designed, optimized, and applied to characterize tumor cells (pan-cytokeratin), T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19, CD20), myeloid cells (CD16, CD56, CD163), dendritic cells (LAMP3), fibroblasts (Î± Smooth Muscle Actin), proliferative status (Ki67) and immunoregulatory molecules (PD1). Spatial metrics were compared among groups. Serial tissue sections were scored for TLS in both H&E and mIF slides. A machine learning model was employed to measure the effect of these metrics on achieving a response to ICB (SD, PR, or CR). A higher density of B lymphocytes (CD20+) was found in responders compared to non-responders to ICB (p=0.022). A positive correlation was observed between mIF and pathologist identification of TLS ( Immune cell densities and TLS spatial location within the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the immune response to HNSCC and may potentially outperform CPS as a predictor of ICB response.
