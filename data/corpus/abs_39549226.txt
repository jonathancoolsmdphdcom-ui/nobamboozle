Research trends, hotspots and future directions of tertiary lymphoid structures in cancer: a comprehensive informatics analysis and visualization study.

Many studies have reported the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in cancer, but the research progress of TLSs in cancer has not been systematically analyzed. Therefore, we analyzed the global scientific knowledge in the field using informatics methods. The results showed that TLSs in cancer have received increasing attention since the 21st century, with an annual publication growth rate of 27.86%. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on machine learning further categorized the research features into four clusters, with the cluster related to immunotherapy being considered an emerging cluster. TLSs and immunotherapy were identified as the top two hotspots with the highest occurrence frequency and total link strength. The Walktrap algorithm indicated that "TLSs, carcinoma, prognostic value" and "high endothelial venules, germinal-centers, node-like structures" are important to TLSs but remain underexplored, representing promising research directions. These findings suggest that cancer-related TLSs have brought new insights into antitumor immunity, and targeting TLSs has the potential to transform the landscape of antitumor immunotherapy.
