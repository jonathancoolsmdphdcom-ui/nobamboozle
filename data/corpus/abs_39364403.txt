Multi-omics profiling and experimental verification of tertiary lymphoid structure-related genes: molecular subgroups, immune infiltration, and prognostic implications in lung adenocarcinoma.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), characterized by a low 5-year survival rate, is the most common and aggressive type of lung cancer. Recent studies have shown that tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which resemble lymphoid structures, are closely linked to the immune response and tumor prognosis. The functions of the tertiary lymphoid structure-related genes (TLS-RGs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are poorly understood. Based on publicly available data, we conducted a comprehensive study of the function of TLS-RGs in LUAD. Initially, we categorized LUAD patients into two TLS and two gene subtypes. Subsequently, risk scores were calculated, and prognostic models were constructed using seven genes (CIITA, FCRL2, GBP1, BIRC3, SCGB1A1, CLDN18, and S100P). To enhance the clinical application of TLS scores, we have developed a precise nomogram. Furthermore, drug sensitivity, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and the cancer stem cell (CSC) index were found to be substantially correlated with the TLS scores. Single-cell sequencing results reflected the distribution of TLS-RGs in cells. Finally, we took the intersection of overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) prognosis-related genes and then further validated the expression of these genes by qRT-PCR. Our in-depth investigation of TLS-RGs in LUAD revealed their possible contributions to the clinicopathological features, prognosis, and characteristics of TME. These findings underscore the potential of TLS-RGs as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LUAD, thereby paving the way for personalized treatment strategies.
