Tertiary lymphoid structures and cancer immunotherapy: From bench to bedside.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized ectopic lymphoid aggregates within the tumor microenvironment that serve as crucial sites for the development of adaptive antitumor cellular and humoral immunity. TLSs have been consistently documented in numerous cancer types, correlating with improved prognosis and enhanced responses to immunotherapy, especially immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB). Given the potential role of TLSs as predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of ICB in cancer patients, the therapeutic manipulation of TLSs is gaining significant attention as a promising avenue for cancer treatment. Herein, we comprehensively review the composition, definition, and detection methods of TLSs in humans. We also discuss the contributions of TLSs to antitumor immunity, their prognostic value in cancer patients, and their association with therapeutic response to ICB-based immunotherapy. Finally, we present preclinical data supporting the potential of therapeutically manipulating TLSs as a promising approach for innovative cancer immunotherapy.
