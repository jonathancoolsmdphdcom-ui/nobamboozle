Podoplanin expressing macrophages and their involvement in tertiary lymphoid structures in mouse models of Sjögren's disease.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are formed in tissues targeted by chronic inflammation processes, such as infection and autoimmunity. In Sjögren's disease, the organization of immune cells into TLS is an important part of disease progression. Here, we investigated the dynamics of tissue resident macrophages in the induction and expansion of salivary gland TLS. We induced Sjögren's disease by cannulation of the submandibular glands of C57BL/6J mice with LucAdV5. In salivary gland tissues from these mice, we analyzed the different macrophage populations prior to cannulation on day 0 and on day 2, 5, 8, 16 and 23 post-infection using multicolored flow cytometry, mRNA gene analysis, and histological evaluation of tissue specific macrophages. The histological localization of macrophages in the LucAdV5 induced inflamed salivary glands was compared to salivary glands of NZBW/F1 lupus prone mice, a spontaneous mouse model of Sjögren's disease. The evaluation of the dynamics and changes in macrophage phenotype revealed that the podoplanin (PDPN) expressing CX3CR1
