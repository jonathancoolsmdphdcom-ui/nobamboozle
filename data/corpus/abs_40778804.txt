High Grade Hepatotoxicity From Dual Checkpoint Inhibitors Is More Common in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Than Other Cancers.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are therapy for many malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the impact of HCC on immune-mediated liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors (ILICI) remains poorly understood and no direct comparison exists for hepatotoxicity rates between ICI and sorafenib in HCC. In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data on adult patients treated with five ICI regimens for HCC or non-HCC cancers, and HCC patients who received sorafenib between 2010 and 2020. The primary outcome was grade ≥ 3 ILICI or sorafenib (DILI). Logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for liver injury. We identified 530 patients, 129 (24%) HCC-ICI, 256 (48%) non-HCC ICI, and 145 (27%) HCC-sorafenib. Compared to non-HCC ICI, HCC-ICI and HCC-sorafenib were more often male (57%, 82%, 77%), Hispanic (14%, 35%, 34%), and cirrhotic (1%, 85%, 88%). Twenty-three patients developed grade ≥ 3 ILICI. ILICI incidence was higher for HCC-ICI (11%, CI 6-18) versus non-HCC ICI (4%, CI 2-6, p = 0.006) and DILI in HCC-sorafenib (3%, CI 1-8, p = 0.02) with incidence highest for ipilimumab-nivolumab (HCC-ICI 42%, CI 15-72 versus non-HCC 10%, CI 3-24; p = 0.02). On multivariable regression, ILICI was associated with HCC (OR 4.5, CI 1.8-11.4, p = 0.002) and treatment with ipilimumab-nivolumab (OR 6.9, CI 2.6-18.3, p < 0.001). Incidence of liver injury in HCC remained elevated for ICI versus sorafenib (OR 3.5, CI 1.2-10.4, p = 0.02). We identified an elevated risk of liver injury in HCC patients receiving ICIs compared to ICI-treated non-HCC cancers and sorafenib-treated HCC, with dual ipilimumab-nivolumab therapy carrying the highest risk.
