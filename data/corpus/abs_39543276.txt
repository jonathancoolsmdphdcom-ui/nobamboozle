Tertiary lymphoid structures potentially promote immune checkpoint inhibitor response in SMARCB1-deficient medullary renal cell carcinoma.

The WHO's classification of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has identified loss of SMARCB1 as one of the driven mutations. Despite intensive postoperative interventions, the prognosis for SMARCB1-deficient medullary RCC remains poor, indicating insufficiency in current therapy. Herein, we reported the treatment outcomes of five patients with metastatic SMARCB1-deficient medullary RCC and molecular correlates. Four patients were treated with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) combination therapy with a median PFS (mPFS) of 12.3 months. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of immune-related pathways in SMARCB1-deficient medullary RCC compared to clear-cell and papillary RCC. Multiple immunofluorescence (mIF) revealed the association between the formation of mature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and the favorable response to ICI-based combination therapy. In conclusion, ICI-based combination therapy showed promising anti-tumor activity in SMARCB1-deficient medullary RCC patients. The presence of mature tertiary TLSs may partially elucidate the mechanism underlying treatment response.
