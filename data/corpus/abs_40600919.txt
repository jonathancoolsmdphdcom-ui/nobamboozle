Innate Immunity and Tertiary Lymphoid Structures.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are ectopic lymphoid tissues that form in response to chronic inflammation, such as in autoimmune diseases or cancer. Their presence has been increasingly recognized as a significant factor in determining patient prognosis and response to cancer treatments. The formation and development of TLSs are intricately linked to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can be induced by the innate immune system. The innate immune system serves as the body's first line of defense against pathogens by producing cytokines and chemokines upon the detection of foreign invaders. The interplay between innate immunity and TLSs is multifaceted and involves various components and mechanisms. Here, we focus on three key aspects. First, the involvement of specific innate immune cell types in TLS dynamics; second, the role of innate immune receptors in TLS formation; lastly, the contributions of innate immune effectors to TLS formation and maintenance. By examining these interconnected aspects, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of how innate immunity regulates the formation and function of TLSs in the context of chronic inflammation and cancer. This knowledge not only enhances our understanding of immune responses but also holds potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting TLSs in various pathological conditions.
