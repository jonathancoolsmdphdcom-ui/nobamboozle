Characterization of Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Meningiomas: Correlation of Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte Aggregates With Tumor Grade.

Malignant meningiomas are aggressive intracranial tumors with high recurrence rates and limited treatment options. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a pivotal role in the tumor progression and treatment response. However, its role in meningioma remains largely unknown. This study aimed to analyze tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the meningioma TIME and investigate their correlation with clinical parameters. Using tumor specimens from patients diagnosed with meningioma (grade 1, 12 cases; grade 2, 10 cases), the densities of CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, CD20+ B-cells, and tissue-resident memory T-cells were quantified using multicolor immunohistochemistry and the QuPath software. The results were analyzed along with clinical parameters, including tumor grades. The density of individual TIL subsets did not correlate with the tumor grades or patients' postoperative neurological function. TIL aggregates were observed in grade 2 meningiomas; clusters of abundant B-cells with a few follicular helper T-cells were observed in one case, indicating the presence of immature tertiary lymphoid structures. A positive correlation was observed between the densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in grade 2 meningiomas but not in grade 1. The TIME in meningiomas exhibits distinct immune profiles by tumor grade, characterized by the presence of TIL aggregates and coordinated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration in higher-grade tumors. These findings may provide insights into the immune landscape of meningiomas and support the development of immunotherapeutic strategies targeting the TIME.
