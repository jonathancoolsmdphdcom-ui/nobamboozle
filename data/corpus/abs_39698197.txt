Heterogeneity of the Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin Tumor Score in Breast Cancer Cells Significantly Affects Tumor Invasiveness, Recurrence, and Patient Survival.

Alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) has been widely investigated in malignancies, primarily concerning its expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) inside the tumor stroma. Microscopic examination indicates that αSMA expression is not confined to the tumor stromal compartment but is also present in a subset of tumor cells, and this expression correlates with an enhanced invasive phenotype of malignant cells from lung, liver, or ovarian malignancies. Information on actin expression in breast cancer (BC) cells is scarce, and its influence on clinicopathological characteristics remains ambiguous due to conflicting findings in the literature. To examine the αSMA tumor score in breast cancer cells utilizing digital image analysis (DIA) methodologies and to critically analyze the varying effects of αSMA tumor score values on clinicopathologic parameters, particularly focusing on tumor cell invasiveness, recurrence, and survival. Double immunostaining for CD34 and αSMA was conducted on 53 breast cancer cases that were thoroughly characterized in relation to clinicopathologic data. Double immunostaining for CD34 and αSMA demonstrated different distribution patterns of both markers in normal and breast cancer tissues. DIA data about αSMA tumor cell density, intensity, tumor score, and histological score were correlated with clinicopathological factors. We delineated three unique breast cancer subgroups based on αSMA tumor scores: a 9.43% low-expressing subgroup (αSMA_TS αSMA-expressing breast cancer cells variably affect malignant growth, invasion, and recurrence, highly contingent upon their density and expression intensity. The current investigation identified an αSMA_TS
