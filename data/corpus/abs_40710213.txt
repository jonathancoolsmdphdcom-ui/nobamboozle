MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations in Lung Cancer: Clinical-Pathological Characteristics and Immune Microenvironment.

MET exon 14 skipping mutations have emerged as significant driver alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), contributing to tumor progression. This study examines the immune microenvironment in NSCLC patients with these mutations and its prognostic implications. We performed multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from nine NSCLC patients, including four recurrent/metastatic and five non-recurrent/non-metastatic patients. Two panels assessed immune cell markers (CD8, CD4, CD20, CD68, and FoxP3) and immune checkpoints (PD-L1, LAG3, and TIM3). Immune cell infiltration and checkpoint expression were analyzed using HALO
