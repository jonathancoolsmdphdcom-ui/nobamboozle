Heterogeneity of tertiary lymphoid structures predicts the response to neoadjuvant therapy and immune microenvironment characteristics in triple-negative breast cancer.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) impact cancer outcomes, including in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where their role in immune modulation during neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is underexplored. This study employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining, and radiomic techniques to evaluate TLSs and the tumour microenvironment (TME) in TNBC patient samples before and after NAT. The presence of TLSs in TNBC was associated with B-cell maturation and T-cell activation. Compared with TLS-low TNBC, TLS-high TNBC showed significantly greater expression of immunoglobulin family genes (IGHM and IGHG1) in B cells and greater cytotoxicity of neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells (neoTCR8). Additionally, mIF revealed notable differences between TLSs and the TME in TNBC. Although CD8 + T-cell levels do not predict the NAT response effectively, TLS maturity strongly correlated with better NAT outcomes and prognosis (P < 0.05). An imaging biomarker scoring system was also developed to predict TLS status and NAT efficacy. Our results demonstrated changes in TLSs and the TME in TNBC patients post-NAT. These findings confirm the predictive value of mature TLSs (mTLSs) and support the use of personalised immunotherapy based on post-NAT immune characteristics, thereby improving clinical outcomes.
