Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal mechanisms of radioresistance and immune escape in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Radiotherapy resistance and immune evasion are prominent features of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). However, their mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis of 39 tumors from 24 patients to reveal the microenvironmental differences between primary and rNPC. Specific MCAM
