Roles and functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tertiary lymphoid structures in gastric cancer progression.

Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1).
