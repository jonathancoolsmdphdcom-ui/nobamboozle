Characteristics and Significance of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Based on Molecular Subtypes in Endometrial Cancer.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics and significance of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in endometrial cancer (EC) based on molecular subtypes. A total of 220 patients with EC were retrospectively enrolled, including 20 with polymerase epsilon ultramutated (POLE-mut), 63 with mismatch repair deficient, 32 with p53 abnormal, and 105 with no specific molecular profile. The presence and maturity of TLSs were determined by immunohistochemical markers (CD3, CD20, CD21, and Bcl6). Disease-free survival served as the endpoint event. TLSs were found in 91 out of 220 patients (41.1%), with 68 located in peritumoral tissues and 37 exhibiting well-formed germinal center structures. The presence and different maturity of TLSs were closely associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the programmed cell death ligand-1 expression. Moreover, TLSs displayed heterogeneity across different molecular subtypes. Notably, the TLSs, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and expression of the programmed cell death ligand-1 were significantly enriched in POLE-mut EC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the presence of TLSs (odds ratio: 3.483, 95% CI: 1.044-11.623, P = 0.042) as a potential predictor of POLE-mut EC. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that molecular subtypes significantly stratified prognosis in patients with EC (P = 0.002), whereas TLSs did not. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and Ki-67 expression were independent prognostic factors affecting disease-free survival in patients with EC, and TLSs were not included. In conclusion, TLSs in EC exhibit heterogeneity based on molecular subtypes, necessitating further exploration to determine their clinical application value.
