Tertiary lymphoid structures in the central nervous system.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) frequently occur at sites of chronic inflammation. A more advanced stage of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with certain TLSs. However, tumor-associated TLSs have been shown to correlate with a greater treatment response rate and a better prognosis in glioma mouse models. In this review, we evaluate the clinical significances of TLSs in prognosis and treatment response, as well as the status of TLS-directed therapies targeting alternative biochemical pathways in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying the development of TLSs are also discussed. Exploring these areas may provide an essential understanding of the processes behind disease advancement, uncover new therapeutic objectives, and detect biomarkers that forecast disease progression and treatment efficacy.
