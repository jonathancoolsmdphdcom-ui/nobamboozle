The Relationship and Mechanism of CD27 with Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease.

CD27, as a member of the immune checkpoints (IC), is physiologically expressed on various immune cells, with CD70 being its only known ligand. Together, they play a significant role in the co-stimulation and activation of T and B cells, regulating the body's immune response. Currently, the CD27/CD70 pathway shows great potential in the clinical treatment of tumors. Previous studies have found that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide significant benefits to cancer patients while also causing various adverse reactions, including cardiovascular diseases. The critical role of inflammation and adaptive immunity in coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) is widely recognized. Studies have found that the absence of CD27 or the blockade of the CD27/CD70 pathway exacerbates the occurrence of CAD. This review mainly summarizes the impact and mechanisms of CD27 and the CD27/CD70 pathway on CAD through immune regulatory pathways, providing important theoretical support for clinical treatment and prevention of adverse events in coronary heart disease, as well as new therapeutic strategies.
