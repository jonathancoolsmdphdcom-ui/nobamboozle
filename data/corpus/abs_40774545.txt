Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Inflammatory Arthritis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) used for the treatment of malignancy are associated with immune related adverse events which include inflammatory arthritis. ICI induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-IA) is a new clinical entity that may lead to functional impairment and may be persistent even after ICI cessation. We discuss the clinical features, investigation and differential diagnosis. Management needs to consider the safety of immunosuppression in the context of the underlying cancer and current practice will be further informed by ongoing clinical trials.
