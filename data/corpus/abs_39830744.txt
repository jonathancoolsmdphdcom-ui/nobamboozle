Discrepancies in PD-L1 expression, lymphocyte infiltration, and tumor mutational burden in non-small cell lung cancer and matched brain metastases.

Differences in the immune microenvironment and responses to immunotherapy may exist between primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases (BMs). This study aimed to investigate discrepancies in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and tumor mutational burden (TMB) between matched BMs and primary tumors (PTs) in NSCLC. Twenty-six pairs of surgically resected BMs and corresponding PTs from NSCLC patients were collected. PD-L1 expression and TILs, including CD8, CD3, CD4, CD20, CD68, and CD21, were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitatively assessed through digital image analysis. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to investigate genomic discrepancies and variations in TMB. The density of PD-L1 Compared to primary NSCLC tumors, matched BMs show an increase in TPS of PD-L1 expression and TMB, but a significant reduction in TILs and loss of mature TLS, suggesting an immune-suppressive microenvironment in BMs. The infiltration of CD20
