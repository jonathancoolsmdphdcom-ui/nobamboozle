Tertiary lymphoid structures in colorectal cancer - organization and immune cell interactions.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), formerly recognized as Crohn's-like structures, serve as crucial biomarkers for evaluating the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding their spatial distribution, cellular composition, and interactions within CRC is paramount for comprehending the immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). TLS are comprised of a T-cellular compartment and a B-cellular compartment, the latter encompassing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), high endothelial venules (HEVs), and lymphatic vessels. While T helper cells predominate in cancer TLS, the specific functions of their subpopulations remain inadequately understood. Notably, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play a central role in the activation of CD8
