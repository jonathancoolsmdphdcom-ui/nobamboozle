Recent advances in nanoparticles with a PD-L1-based therapy combination of chemotherapy for lung cancer.

Globally, lung cancer (LC) continues to be the primary cause of cancer-related fatalities. The clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) follows significantly behind that of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In advanced NSCLC, combining chemotherapy (CHT) with PD-L1 inhibitors has increased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival, especially in patients with high PD-L1 expression. Additionally, a new standard of therapy for extensive-stage SCLC has been authorized for atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide. However, the combination of PD-L1 inhibitors plus CHT raises the risk of toxicities associated with CHT as well as immune-related side effects such as hepatitis, colitis, and pneumonitis. To minimize side effects, using nanoparticles (NPs) for medication delivery in immunochemotherapy for LC is crucial. In preclinical applications, NPs with transport and/or immunomodulation capabilities have been effectively integrated with ICT. Delivery NPs safeguard and regulate the intended release of their cargo. Generally speaking, we have examined the various ICHT-based LC treatment options in this research. The types of NPs available to mitigate the limitations of this treatment for LC have been studied. Lastly, we covered the clinical constraints and strategies to reduce them. This review article combines evidence from a wide range of sources, including PubMed/NCBI, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov, all published within the last few years.
