Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses identify apo-transcobalamin-II as a biomarker of overall survival in osteosarcoma.

The large-scale proteomic platform known as the SomaScan® assay is capable of simultaneously measuring thousands of proteins in patient specimens through next-generation aptamer-based multiplexed technology. While previous studies have utilized patient peripheral blood to suggest serum biomarkers of prognostic or diagnostic value in osteosarcoma (OSA), the most common primary pediatric bone cancer, they have ultimately been limited in the robustness of their analyses. We propose utilizing this aptamer-based technology to describe the systemic proteomic milieu in patients diagnosed with this disease. To determine novel biomarkers associated with overall survival in OSA, we deployed the SomaLogic SomaScan® 7k assay to investigate the plasma proteomic profile of naive primary, recurrent, and metastatic OSA patients. Following identification of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between 2-year deceased and survivor cohorts, publicly available databases including Survival Genie, TIGER, and KM Plotter Immunotherapy, among others, were utilized to investigate the significance of our proteomic findings. Apo-transcobalamin-II (APO-TCN2) was identified as the most DEP between 2-year deceased and survivor cohorts (Log2 fold change = 6.8, P-value = 0.0017). Survival analysis using the Survival Genie web-based platform indicated that increased intratumoral  Overall, APO-TCN2, a circulatory protein previously described in various lymphoproliferative disorders, was associated with 2-year survival status in patients diagnosed with OSA. The relevance of this protein and apparent immunological function (anti-tumor B lymphocyte responses) was suggested using publicly available solid tumor RNA-sequencing datasets. Further studies characterizing the biological function of APO-TCN2 and its relevance in these diseases is warranted.
