The clinical and pathological significance of tertiary lymphoid structure in extramammary Paget's disease.

Tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are functional immune-responsive aggregates, which have been reported to be associated with better prognosis in various tumors. However, their exact characteristics and prognostic value in extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) remain unknown. To explore the features of TLSs in EMPD and their association with clinicopathological characteristics. In total, 171 EMPD patients from 2015 to 2023, retrospective, single center cohort were collected to assess the presence, maturation status, and location of TLSs by immunohistochemistry. Then, their clinicopathologic association and prognostic significance were further examined. TLSs were detected in 97 cases (57%) of 171 EMPD patients, including high-density TLSs in 88 cases (91%), peritumoral TLSs (pTLSs) in 89 cases (92%), TLSs around appendages (aTLSs) in 23 cases (24%), and mature TLSs in 16 cases (16%). Secondary EMPD was more likely to produce TLS (Secondary: 16/21 [76%]; Primary: 81/150 [54%];  Retrospective study design. Mature TLS is a positive prognostic factor for invasive EMPD and may serve as a new biomarker and therapeutic target for EMPD.
