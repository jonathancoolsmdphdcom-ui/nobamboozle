Tirelizumab-Induced Immune Encephalitis: A Case Report.

In the contemporary landscape of oncology, immune checkpoint blockade therapy has emerged as a paramount therapeutic modality. However, concomitant with the pervasive deployment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), there has been an escalating incidence of adverse drug reactions over the years. Immunological encephalitis, a prevalent form of central nervous system toxicity, poses a significant threat to the lives of affected patients. A 65-year-old male patient, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, experienced an atypical immune-mediated encephalitis of clinical nature after the administration of a PD-1 inhibitor, specifically Tirelizumab. The present investigation delved into the clinical presentations and suitable therapeutic protocols for immune-mediated encephalitis.
