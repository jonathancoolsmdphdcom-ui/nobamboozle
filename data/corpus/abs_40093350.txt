Intertumoral heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment in high grade canine mast cell tumors.

Canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) are a common, yet clinically challenging tumor type given their variable biological behavior. Although patients with low grade MCTs can often be effectively managed with surgery alone, most dogs with high grade MCTs succumb to their disease despite multimodal therapy. An improved understanding of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) may help identify novel prognostic and therapeutic targets. In this study, we interrogated the immune transcriptional profiles of the TME in low and high grade MCTs, and quantified intratumoral T cells. Twelve client-owned dogs with MCTs (6 Kiupel low grade with clinically benign behavior and 6 Kiupel high grade with clinically aggressive behavior) that underwent curative-intent surgery were selected. Tumor grade was confirmed by a single veterinary pathologist. RNA was extracted from all tumors followed by immune transcriptional profiling utilizing the NanoString Canine IO panel and analysis using the ROSALIND platform. T cell density was determined by immunohistochemical staining for CD3 and quantified using ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems) following digital slide capture. Lymphocytic infiltrate was further characterized in the TME of one high grade MCT using co-immunofluorescence. Immune transcriptional profiling identified 9 differentially expressed genes between low and high grade MCTs (p-adj < 0.05). Programmed cell death protein 1 ( Our data revealed significant differences in the immune TME of low and high grade MCTs and provides rationale to further investigate potential prognostic and therapeutic roles of immune checkpoints in canine MCTs.
