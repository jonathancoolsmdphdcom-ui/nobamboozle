Tertiary lymphoid structure formation induced by LIGHT-engineered and photosensitive nanoparticles-decorated bacteria enhances immune response against colorectal cancer.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are known to enhance the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by fostering an immunologically active tumor microenvironment (TME). Inducing TLS formation therapeutically holds promise for treating immunologically cold CRC, though it poses technical challenges. Here, we design and fabricate a photosensitive bacterial system named E@L-P/ICG. This system is engineered bacteria internally loaded with the cytokine LIGHT and surface-modified with PLGA/ICG nanoparticles (P/ICG NPs). Once accumulated in orthotopic colonic tumors in mice, E@L-P/ICG generates a mild photothermal effect under laser irradiation due to the photosensitive P/ICG NPs. This photothermal effect triggers the self-rupture of E@L-P/ICG and the death of surrounding tumor cells to release adjuvants and antigens, respectively, which in turn synergistically activate the adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, the cytokine LIGHT released from ruptured E@L-P/ICG stimulates the generation of high endothelial vessels (HEVs), promoting lymphocyte recruitment within the TME. These mechanisms lead to the TLS formation in CRC, which further boosts adaptive immune responses through effective infiltration of T cells and B cells, resulting in effectively inhibited tumor growth and extended survival of mice. Our study shows the potential of the E@L-P/ICG system in photosensitively inducing the TLS formation to treat CRC in clinic.
