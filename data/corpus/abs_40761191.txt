SMARCB1/INI1-deficient lung cancer with lymph node metastasis: a case report and literature review.

Switch/Sucrose non-fermentable-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1/integrase interactor 1 (SMARCB1/INI1)-deficient lung cancer is a very rare and highly invasive malignant tumor, of which clinicians and pathologists often have limited understanding. We present a 54-year-old man with SMARCB1/INI1-deficient lung cancer, pathologically confirmed by computed tomography guided percutaneous pulmonary mass biopsy and ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy. Both lymphoids and lung tissues showed INI1 deletion and high Ki-67 index; next generation sequencing (NGS) indicated a tumor protein 53 ( We provided the clinical symptoms, imaging data, and literature findings of this rare case of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient lung cancer with lymph node metastasis as a reference, hoping to help clinicians and pathologists have a better understanding of it and avoid misdiagnosis.
