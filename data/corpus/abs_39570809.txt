Mapping of the T-cell Landscape of Biliary Tract Cancer Unravels Anatomic Subtype-Specific Heterogeneity.

Biliary tract cancer (BTC), encompassing diseases such as intrahepatic (ICC), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), and gallbladder cancer, is not only increasing but also poses a significant and urgent health threat due to its high malignancy. Genomic differences point to the possibility that these subtypes represent distinct diseases. Elucidation of the specific distribution of T-cell subsets, critical to cancer immunity, across these diseases could provide better insights into the unique biology of BTC subtypes and help identify potential precision medicine strategies. To address this, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing and T-cell receptor sequencing on CD3+ T cells from 36 samples from 16 patients with BTC across all subtypes and analyzed 355 pathologic slides to examine the spatial distribution of T cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. Compared with ICC and gallbladder cancer, ECC possessed a unique immune profile characterized by T-cell exhaustion, elevated CXCL13 expression in CD4+ T helper-like and CD8+CXCL13+ exhausted T cells, more mature tertiary lymphoid structures, and fewer desert immunophenotypes. Conversely, ICC displayed an inflamed immunophenotype with an enrichment of IFN-related pathways and high expression of LGALS1 in activated regulatory T cells, associated with immunosuppression. Inhibition of LGALS1 reduced tumor growth and regulatory T-cell prevalence in ICC mouse models. Overall, this study unveils T-cell diversity across BTC subtypes at the single-cell and spatial level that could open paths for tailored immunotherapies. Significance: Single-cell and spatial analyses detailed the T-cell characteristics specific to anatomic subtypes of biliary tract cancer, identifying unique immunologic features that could potentially be harnessed to improve patient outcomes.
