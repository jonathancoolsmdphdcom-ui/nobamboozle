Prognostic Significance of a 9-Gene Signature Related to Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Male Stomach Adenocarcinoma Patients.

The role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear despite their known potential effects on tumor progression and prognosis. Data were collected from 362 patients with STAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using single-sample genomic enrichment analysis, TLSs were quantified based on a 9-gene signature, and the patients were categorized into TLS-signature high (TLS-high) and TLS-signature low (TLS-low) groups. The association of TLS signature with prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME) immune status, tumor mutation burden, and gene mutation status was evaluated. The GSE26253 cohort served as an external dataset to validate the prognostic predictive effect of the TLS signature in patients with STAD. The TLS-high group exhibited notably lower overall survival (OS) among male patients with STAD from the TCGA cohort ( In the TCGA cohort, the TLS signature acted as an independent adverse prognostic factor for male patients with stage I-III STAD and was associated with immunosuppressive TME, which interacted to affect patient prognosis. However, adjuvant therapy may affect the prognostic predictive effect of TLS in male patients with stage I-III STAD.
