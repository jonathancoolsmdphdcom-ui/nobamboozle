Constitutive inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition dictate sensitivity to nivolumab in CONFIRM: a placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial.

Leveraging adaptive tumour immunity to control mesothelioma via immune checkpoint blockade is now a standard therapeutic approach. However, the determinants of sensitivity remain elusive. Low non-synonymous mutation burden and programmed death-ligand 1 expression, an abundance of immunosuppressive immune cell infiltration, and 9p21 deletion should all mitigate responses to therapy. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of the PD1 inhibitor, nivolumab (ClinicalTrial.gov registration: NCT03063450). After 37.2 months of follow-up, the primary endpoint of progression free-survival, but not overall survival was met. The nivolumab response rate was 10.3%, and related grade 3 or above adverse events occurred in 20.4% versus 7.2% for placebo. Progression-free and overall survival were longer in nivolumab-treated responders versus non-responders. In an exploratory multiomicÂ analysis, blinded whole exome, transcriptome and multiplex immune profiling were used to interrogate R- versus NR-subgroups. Non-synonymous and neoantigen mutation burden were no different between groups, however R-mesotheliomas were infiltrated with activated CD8
