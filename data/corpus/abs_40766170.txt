Pembrolizumab-Induced Severe Pneumonitis in a Patient With Lung Adenocarcinoma After Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation: A Case Report.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are essential treatments for lung cancer, but their safety following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. We report a case of a 66-year-old man who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and later developed lung adenocarcinoma. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was initiated, but the patient developed severe steroid-refractory immune-related pneumonitis, leading to mortality 56â€‰days after treatment initiation. Given the scarcity of reports on ICI use in lung cancer patients with prior HSCT, this case highlights critical safety considerations.
