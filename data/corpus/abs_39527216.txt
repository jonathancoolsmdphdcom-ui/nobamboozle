Maturation of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized collections of B and T lymphocytes that arise in nonlymphoid tissue in response to chronic, unresolved inflammation. TLS have structural and functional similarities to germinal centers found in lymph nodes and are believed to support the establishment of lymph node-like adaptive immune responses at local sites of inflammation. However, understanding of the underlying biology of these structures remains limited, particularly the different stages of TLS life cycle and the signals governing the initiation, maturation, and termination of TLS. Here, we review current understanding of the maturation of TLS and the signals and cell types involved in various stages of development with particular emphasis on recent studies of TLS in cancer, where evidence suggests that TLS may play an important role in supporting antitumor immune responses in solid tumors.
