Spatial dynamics of CD39

Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy for esophageal squamous cell cancer, the key immune cell populations that affect ICB efficacy remain unclear. Here, imaging mass cytometry of tumor tissues from ICB-treated patients identifies a distinct cell population of CD39
