BRD4 inhibition leads to MDSC apoptosis and enhances checkpoint blockade therapy.

BRD4 is an epigenetic reader protein that regulates oncogenes such as myc in cancer. However, its additional role in shaping immune responses via regulation of inflammatory and myeloid cell responses is not yet fully understood. This work further characterized the multifaceted role of BRD4 in anti-tumor immunity. NanoString gene expression analysis of EMT6 tumors treated with a BRD4 inhibitor identified a reduction in myeloid gene expression signatures. Additionally, BRD4 inhibition significantly reduced myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the spleens and tumors of mice in multiple tumor models and also decreased the release of tumor-derived MDSC growth and chemotactic factors. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4 in MDSC induced apoptosis and modulated expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. A BRD4-myeloid specific knockout model suggested that the dominant mechanism of MDSC reduction after BRD4 inhibition was primarily through a direct effect on MDSC. BRD4 inhibition enhanced anti-PD-L1 therapy in the EMT6, 4T1, and LLC tumor models, and the efficacy of the combination treatment was dependent on CD8+ T cells and on BRD4 expression in the myeloid compartment. These results identify BRD4 as a regulator of MDSC survival and provide evidence to further investigate BRD4 inhibitors in combination with immune based therapies.
