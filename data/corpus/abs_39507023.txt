Inflammation, tertiary lymphoid structures, and lung cancer: a bibliometric analysis.

The intricate interplay between inflammation and lung cancer has long been recognized by large number of studies, yet a comprehensive understanding of this relationship remains elusive. There is a clinical need to elucidate the role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in lung cancer, particularly their impact on prognosis and therapy. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a bibliometric analysis to explore the correlations between lung cancer, inflammation, and TLS, highlighting collaborative networks, publication trends, and emerging research directions. This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature on lung cancer and inflammation from 2013 to 2023 using the Web of Science Core Collection database. The search strategy "topic (TS) = ('lung cancer') AND TS = (inflammation)" yielded 5,470 records, which were refined through exclusion criteria to 1,284 relevant studies. The inclusion process involved excluding non-English studies and non-original articles or reviews, followed by a relevance check based on titles and abstracts. The bibliometric indicators were calculated based on a transparent and repeatable methodology to ensure the integrity of the findings. The investigation encompassed 1,284 selected studies, revealing an escalating publication trend since 2013. The interdisciplinary scope of research is apparent, with contributions from 54 countries, with China at the forefront. In-depth author and journal analyses exposed key contributors like Zhang L and influential journals like " This study underscores the pivotal role of inflammation in lung cancer progression, mediated by a delicate balance of immune responses. The emerging prominence of TLS as indicator of adaptive immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME) offers intriguing avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions. However, limitations in the current research, such as the need for more longitudinal studies and clinical trials, must be addressed. The insights gained from this bibliometric analysis can inform clinical practices and guide future investigations into novel strategies to improve patient outcomes.
