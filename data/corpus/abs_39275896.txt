The efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and lymphocyte subset predictors in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A retrospective study.

Despite the recognized therapeutic potential of programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), their role in neoadjuvant therapy and reliable efficacy biomarkers remain elusive. We retrospectively analyzed locally advanced ESCC patients who underwent surgery following a 2-cycle platinum and paclitaxel-based treatment, with or without PD-1 inhibitors (January 2020-March 2023). We assessed peripheral blood indexes and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) density to evaluate their impact on pathological response and prognosis, leading to a clinical prediction model for treatment efficacy and survival. Of the 157 patients recruited, 106 received immunochemotherapy (ICT) and 51 received chemotherapy (CT) alone. The ICT group demonstrated a superior pathological response rate (PRR) (47.2% vs. 29.4%, p = 0.034) with comparable adverse events and postoperative complications. The ICT group also showed a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 39.8 months, unattained by the CT group. The 1-year DFS and overall survival (OS) rates were 73% and 91% for the ICT group, and 68% and 81% for the CT group, respectively. We found higher baseline activated T cells, lower baseline Treg cells, and a decreased posttreatment total lymphocyte and CD4 The combination of PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy appears promising for locally advanced ESCC. Evaluating the differentiation status and dynamic changes of peripheral blood immune cells may provide valuable predictive insights into treatment efficacy and prognosis.
