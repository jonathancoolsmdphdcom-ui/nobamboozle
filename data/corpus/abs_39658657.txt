Multi-omic profiling highlights factors associated with resistance to immuno-chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.

Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have shifted the treatment paradigm for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients remain resistant. Here we characterize the tumor cell states and spatial cellular compositions of the NSCLC tumor microenvironment (TME) by analyzing single-cell transcriptomes of 232,080 cells and spatially resolved transcriptomes of tumors from 19 patients before and after ICB-chemotherapy. We find that tumor cells and secreted phosphoprotein 1-positive macrophages interact with collagen type XI alpha 1 chain-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts to stimulate the deposition and entanglement of collagen fibers at tumor boundaries, obstructing T cell infiltration and leading to poor prognosis. We also reveal distinct states of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the TME. Activated TLSs are associated with improved prognosis, whereas a hypoxic microenvironment appears to suppress TLS development and is associated with poor prognosis. Our study provides novel insights into different cellular and molecular components corresponding to NSCLC ICB-chemotherapeutic responsiveness, which will benefit future individualized immuno-chemotherapy.
