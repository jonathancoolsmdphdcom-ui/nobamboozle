B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in tumors: immunity cycle, clinical impact, and therapeutic applications.

Tumorigenesis involves a multifaceted and heterogeneous interplay characterized by perturbations in individual immune surveillance. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as orchestrators of adaptive immune responses, constitute the principal component of tumor immunity. Over the past decade, the functions of tumor-specific T cells have been extensively elucidated, whereas current understanding and research regarding intratumoral B cells remain inadequate and underexplored. The delineation of B cell subsets is contingent upon distinct surface proteins and the specific transcription factors that define these subsets have yet to be fully described. Consequently, there is a pressing need for extensive and comprehensive exploration into tumor-infiltrating B cells and their cancer biology. Notably, B cells and other cellular entities assemble within the tumor milieu to establish tertiary lymphoid structures that facilitate localized immune activation and furnish novel insights for tumor research. It is of great significance to develop therapeutic strategies based on B cells, antibodies, and tertiary lymphoid structures. In this review, we address the role of B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in tumor microenvironment, with the highlight on their spatiotemporal effect, prognostic value and therapeutic applications in tumor immunity.
