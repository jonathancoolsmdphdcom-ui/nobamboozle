Lympho-myeloid aggregate-infiltrating CD20

According to morphological features, tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) can be classified as lympho-myeloid aggregates (LMAs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). As a disease with high incidence and mortality, research on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) TIL-Bs is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value and functional involvement of TIL-Bs in ESCC. Based on CD20 immunohistochemical staining of 147 ESCC samples, the TIL-Bs at different anatomic subregions (intra-tumor (T), invasive margin (IM) and peri-tumor (P)) were quantified and correlated with survival by Kaplan-Meier analyses. We found that LMAs were widely distributed throughout the whole section and were associated with poor prognosis, especially those located in the T subregion, which was contrary to the positive clinical significance of TLSs. Based on the number of LMAs and TLSs, a four-level immune type was constructed as an independent predictor for survival. Using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) staining, we found that the main phenotype of infiltrating B cells in LMAs was CD20
