CD40L stimulates tumor-infiltrating B-cells and improves ex vivo TIL expansion.

Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is now a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for melanoma. While this is a major milestone, there is room for improvement to increase clinical response rates and to further optimize the manufacturing of TIL products. In this study, we characterized the association of tumor-infiltrating B-cells (TIL-B) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) with clinical response to TIL therapy and tested whether the presence of B-cells in the tumor can be leveraged to optimize TIL manufacture. Tumor sections from TIL responders (R, n=9) and non-responders (NR, n=11) were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and immune cell content was estimated in silico. To study the association between B-cells and TIL expansion, we quantified B-cell subsets and TIL phenotype by flow cytometry. CD40L-induced effects on melanoma-infiltrating B-cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and scRNA-sequencing. Tumors from TIL clinical responders had greater abundance of class-switched B-cells (p=0.007) and a greater TLS score (p=0.03) than those of NRs. In addition, greater abundance of B-cells (pâ‰¤0.05) and switched memory B-cells (CD27 Our results show that CD40L-stimulated B-cells can be leveraged to enhance the quality and quantity of TIL. Clinical trial NCT05681780 is currently testing this concept applied to NSCLC TIL.
