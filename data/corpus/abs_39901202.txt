Immune microenvironment spatial landscapes of tertiary lymphoid structures in gastric cancer.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) correlate with tumour prognosis and immunotherapy responses in gastric cancer (GC) studies. However, understanding the complex and diverse immune microenvironment within TLS requires comprehensive analysis. We examined the prognostic impact of TLS within the tumour core (TC) of 59 GC patients undergoing immunotherapy. Multispectral fluorescence imaging was employed to evaluate variations in immune cell infiltration across different TLS sites among 110 GC patients, by quantifying immune cell density and spatial characteristics. We also generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of TLS-positive (n = 4) and TLS-negative (n = 8) microenvironments and performed spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis on two samples. TLS presence in the TC significantly correlated with improved immune-related overall survival (P = 0.049). CD8 TLS presence facilitates frequent cell-to-cell communication, forming an active immune microenvironment, highlighting the prognostic value of TLS.
