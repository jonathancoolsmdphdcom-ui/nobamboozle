[Clinical significance of tertiary lymphoid structure maturity in colorectal cancer patients].

To explore the clinical significance of the tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) maturity in colorectal cancer patients. A total of 230 surgically removed colorectal cancer specimens with detailed follow-up data were collected from Yinzhou Second Hospital. The patients were divided into mature TLS group and immature TLS group according to immunohistochemical results. The patient age, gender, maximum tumor diameter, tumor location, differentiation degree, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, vascular tumor thrombus, liver metastasis, distant non-liver metastasis, mismatch repair status, expression of Ki-67, P53 and programmed death-ligand (PD-L) 1 were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method (Breslow test) was used to analyze the survival of patients, and multivariate Cox regression model was applied to analyze the prognostic factors. There were 128 cases of mature TLS and 102 cases of immature TLS. Compared to the immature TLS group, the mature TLS group showed a significantly lower rate of vascular tumor thrombus, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis. Additionally, the positive expression rate of Ki-67 was markedly reduced, while the rate of deficient mismatch repair and the positive rate of PD-L1 were significantly increased (all  The formation of TLS may play a significant role in inhibiting lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, and vascular tumor thrombus in colorectal cancer. In addition, patients with mature TLS have a favorable clinical prognosis.
