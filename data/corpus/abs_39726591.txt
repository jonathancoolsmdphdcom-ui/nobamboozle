TLS and immune cell profiling: immunomodulatory effects of immunochemotherapy on tumor microenvironment in resectable stage III NSCLC.

The use of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable stage III NSCLC has revolutionized this field in recent years. However, there is still 40%-60% of patients do not benefit from this approach. The complex interactions between immune cell subtypes and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may influence prognosis and the response to immunochemotherapy. This study aims to assess the relationship between immune cells subtypes and TLSs to better understand their impact on immunotherapy response. This study initially compared the tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) density among patients who underwent immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy and upfront surgery using 123 tumor samples from stage-matched patients. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) was employed to analyze the spatial distribution of PD-L1+CD11c+ cells and PD1+CD8+ T cells within TLSs. Cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was used to assess immune cell dynamics in paired biopsy and resection specimens from six patients who underwent immunochemotherapy. Key immune cells were validated in newly collected samples using flow cytometry, mIHC, and  Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy exhibited increased TLSs compared to those who opted for upfront surgery. The TLS area-to-tumor area ratio distinguished pCR+MPR and NR patients in the immunochemotherapy group. Spatial analysis revealed variations in the distance between PD-L1+CD11c+ cells and PD1+CD8+ T cells within TLSs in the immunochemotherapy group. CyTOF analysis revealed an increase in the frequency of key immune cells (CCR7+CD127+CD69+CD4+ and CD38+CD8+ cells) following combined therapy. Treatment responders exhibited an increase in CCR7+CD4+ T cells, whereas CD38+CD8+ T cells were associated with compromised treatment effectiveness. Immunochemotherapy and chemotherapy increase TLSs and granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in tumors. The TLS area-to-tumor ratio distinguishes responders from non-responders, with PD-L1+ dendritic cells near CD8+PD-1+ T cells linked to efficacy, suggesting that PD-1 inhibitors disrupt harmful interactions. Post-immunochemotherapy, CD8+ T cells increase, but CD38+CD8+ T cells show reduced functionality. These findings highlight the complex immune dynamics and their implications for NSCLC treatment.
