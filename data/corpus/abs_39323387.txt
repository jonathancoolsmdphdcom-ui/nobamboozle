Acute kidney injury results in long-term alterations of kidney lymphatics in mice.

The long-term effects of a single episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (BIRI) on kidney lymphatic dynamics are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine if alterations in kidney lymphatics are sustained in the long term and how they relate to inflammation and injury. Mice underwent BIRI as a model of AKI and were followed up to 9 mo. Although kidney function markers normalized following initial injury, histological analysis revealed sustained tissue damage and inflammation for up to 9 mo. Transcriptional analysis showed both acute and late-stage lymphangiogenesis, supported by increased expression of lymphatic markers, with unique signatures at each phase. Expression of
