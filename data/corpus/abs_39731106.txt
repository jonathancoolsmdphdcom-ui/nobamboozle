Association of PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8 ratio and tertiary lymphoid structures with prognosis and response in advanced gastric cancer patients receiving preoperative treatment.

Recent studies have highlighted the distinct ratio of PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8 for prognosis prediction. However, it remains unclear about the association of this ratio and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) with prognosis and response to neoadjuvant or conversion therapy in advanced gastric cancer. Firstly, fresh postoperative samples from 68 gastric cancer patients in Renji Hospital were collected. Meanwhile, immune cell infiltration as well as clinical prognosis analysis were conducted. Subsequently, we further systematically evaluated flow cytometry analysis of tumor samples and TLS expression in 38 gastric cancer patients with different response situations after neoadjuvant therapy. Also, a Renji conversion therapy cohort including 10 patients with complete matching samples before and after treatment was established to receive RNA sequencing analysis and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) tests. The corresponding TLS score and immune cell infiltration were further compared based on therapeutic response variations. In general, the ratio of PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8>1 could be regarded as an independent predictor of prognosis in advanced gastric cancer patients. Moreover, PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8 < 1 and high expression of TLS could indicate better neoadjuvant therapy response and extended survival time in advanved gastric cancer patients. Besides, PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8  This study underlined that combining PD-1 + Treg/PD-1 + CD8 ratio and TLS were significantly associated with prognosis and preoperative treatment response in advanced gastric cancer. Inspiringly, these indicators have the potential to elucidate the immune balance of advanced gastric cancer patients and can accurately guide subsequent therapeutic strategies.
