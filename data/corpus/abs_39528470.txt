Single-cell landscape identified SERPINB9 as a key player contributing to stemness and metastasis in non-seminomas.

Embryonal carcinoma (EC), characterized by a high degree of stemness similar to that of embryonic stem cells, is the most malignant subtype within non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). However, the mechanisms underlying its malignancy remain unknown. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze four non-seminoma samples. Our differential expression analysis revealed high expression of SERPINB9 in metastatic EC cells. We conducted in vitro experiments to further investigate SERPINB9's role in the progression of EC. Functionally, the knockdown of SERPINB9 in NCCIT and NTERA-2 leads to a diminished migratory capability and decreased cis-platin resistance, as demonstrated by Transwell migration assay and drug sensitivity assay. Moreover, embryoid bodies showed reduced size and lower OCT4 expression, alongside heightened expression of differentiation markers AFP, ACTA2, and CD57 in shSERPINB9 cells. In vivo, the role of SERPINB9 in maintaining cancer stemness was validated by the limiting dilution assay. Mechanistically, Bulk RNA-seq further showed downregulation of ERK1/2 signaling and WNT signaling pathways with concomitant upregulation of differentiation pathways subsequent to SERPINB9 knockdown. Additionally, the analysis indicated increased levels of cytokines linked to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), such as IL6, IL11, IL15, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL13 in shSERPINB9 cells, which were further validated by ELISA. Our research indicates that SERPINB9 plays a key role in driving tumor progression by enhancing tumor stemness and suppressing TLS. This study stands as the first to elucidate the molecular signature of non-seminomas at a single-cell level, presenting a wealth of promising targets with substantial potential for informing the development of future therapeutic interventions.
