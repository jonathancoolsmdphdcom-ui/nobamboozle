Advances in renal cancer: diagnosis, treatment, and emerging technologies.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of current practices and recent advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of renal cancer. It introduces updates in histological classification and explains the imaging characteristics of each tumour based on these changes. The review highlights state-of-the-art imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and ultrasound, emphasising their crucial role in tumour characterisation and optimising treatment planning. Emerging technologies, such as radiomics and artificial intelligence, are also discussed for their transformative impact on enhancing diagnostic precision, prognostic prediction, and personalised patient management. Furthermore, the review explores current treatment options, including minimally invasive techniques such as cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, and stereotactic body radiation therapy, as well as systemic therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies.
