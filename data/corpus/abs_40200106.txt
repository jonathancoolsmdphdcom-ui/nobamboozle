Tertiary lymphoid structures associated with improved survival and enhanced antitumor immunity in acral melanoma.

Understanding the impact of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) on acral melanoma (AM) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical. We analyzed TLS features in primary AM lesions from 46 patients and identified intratumoral TLSs (intra-TLSs) in 25 patients. Intra-TLS presence was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and multiplex immunofluorescence revealed increased T-cell and CD8
