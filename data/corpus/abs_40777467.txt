ETS1 Orchestrates a Hybrid EMT Program Driving in vivo Metastasis and Immune Evasion.

Transcriptional Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a hallmark of aggressive cancers, yet how transcriptional ITH programs drive tumor metastasis and immune evasion in upper aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma (UASCC) remains unclear. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of UASCC cells and patient tumors, we uncovered a hybrid epithelial mesenchymal transition (hEMT) ITH program linked to metastatic dissemination. The transcription factor ETS1 was identified as a master regulator of the hEMT program, directly activating pro-metastatic genes and promoting distant spread in vivo. Unexpectedly, ETS1 also orchestrated an immune-cold tumor microenvironment by transcriptionally activating both
