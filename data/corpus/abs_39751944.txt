Tertiary lymphoid structures in high-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma: anatomical site matters.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in the tumor microenvironment are prognostically beneficial in many solid cancer types. Reports on TLS in high-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) are few, and the prognostic impact is unclear. We investigated mature TLS (mTLS), immature TLS (iTLS) and lymphoid aggregates (LA) in primary adnexal tumors (PTs) and synchronous omental/peritoneal metastases (pMets) of HGSC. Whole H&E slides were scrutinized for mTLS and LA in a population-based cohort of 130 cases with stage III-IV HGSC. The immune cell tumor infiltration was evaluated with single chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tissue microarray (TMA) from the same cases. Selected whole slides (PT n = 11, pMet n = 10) of the cases most abundant in mTLS and LA were further investigated with multiplex IHC and immunofluorescence using digital image analysis (QuPath), to confirm TLS status and map the T and B lymphocyte subtypes. The results showed that mTLS were more common in pMets than in PTs but did not have an independent prognostic impact on overall or progression-free survival. The presence of mTLS correlated with intratumoral infiltration of CD8
