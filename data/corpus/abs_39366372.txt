Spatial oncology: Translating contextual biology to the clinic.

Microscopic examination of cells in their tissue context has been the driving force behind diagnostic histopathology over the past two centuries. Recently, the rise of advanced molecular biomarkers identified through single cell profiling has increased our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in cancer but have yet to significantly impact clinical care. Spatial technologies integrating molecular profiling with microenvironmental features are poised to bridge this translational gap by providing critical in situ context for understanding cellular interactions and organization. Here, we review how spatial tools have been used to study tumor ecosystems and their clinical applications. We detail findings in cell-cell interactions, microenvironment composition, and tissue remodeling for immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Additionally, we highlight the emerging role of multi-omic spatial profiling for characterizing clinically relevant features including perineural invasion, tertiary lymphoid structures, and the tumor-stroma interface. Finally, we explore strategies for clinical integration and their augmentation of therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.
