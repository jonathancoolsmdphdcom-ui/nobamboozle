Tertiary Lymphoid Structures are Linked to Enhanced Antitumor Immunity and Better Prognosis in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.

The prognosis for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) remains poor, and reliable prognostic markers have yet to be identified. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with favorable outcomes in certain cancers. However, the relationship between TLS and MIBC remains unclear. A multi-omics approach is utilized, leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry, to investigate the roles of B cells and TLS in MIBC. These findings indicate that elevated levels of B cells and TLS correlate with improved prognoses in patients with MIBC, aligning with the robust antitumor immune responses observed in the TLS region. From a mechanistic perspective, CXCL13 serves as a critical cytokine for TLS formation in MIBC, primarily secreted by clonally expanded CXCL13+ T cells. This cytokine interacts with the CXCR5 receptor on NR4A2+ B cells, promoting TLS development. Plasma cells arising within the TLS microenvironment predominantly produce the IGHG antibody, potentially enhancing the phagocytic capabilities of C1QC+ macrophages. From an application standpoint, a TLS-specific gene signature is developed that effectively predicts outcomes in MIBC and other cancers. This study highlights the prognostic potential of TLS in MIBC and reveals immune mechanisms, offering insights for personalized treatment strategies.
