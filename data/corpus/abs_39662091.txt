Skin immune-mesenchymal interplay within tertiary lymphoid structures promotes autoimmune pathogenesis in hidradenitis suppurativa.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinized epithelial tunnels that grow deeply into the dermis. Here, we examined the immune microenvironment within human HS lesions. Multi-omics profiling and multiplexed imaging identified tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) near HS tunnels. These TLSs were enriched with proliferative T cells, including follicular helper (Tfh), regulatory (Treg), and pathogenic T cells (IL17A+ and IFNG+), alongside extensive clonal expansion of plasma cells producing antibodies reactive to keratinocytes. HS fibroblasts express CXCL13 or CCL19 in response to immune cytokines. Using a microfluidic system to mimic TLS on a chip, we found that HS fibroblasts critically orchestrated lymphocyte aggregation via tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-CXCL13 and TNF-α-CCL19 feedback loops with B and T cells, respectively; early TNF-α blockade suppressed aggregate initiation. Our findings provide insights into TLS formation in the skin, suggest therapeutic avenues for HS, and reveal mechanisms that may apply to other autoimmune settings, including Crohn's disease.
