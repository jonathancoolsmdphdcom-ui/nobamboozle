Perioperative chemoimmunotherapy induces strong immune responses and long-term survival in patients with HLA class I-deficient non-small cell lung cancer.

Loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are common events implicated in the primary resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to immunotherapy. However, there is no data on perioperative chemoimmunotherapy (ChIO) efficacy or response mechanisms in the context of HLA class I defects. Baseline HLA class I tumor status (HLA-deficient (HLA-DEF) or HLA-proficient (HLA-PRO)) was determined by DNA LOH combined with immunohistochemistry for protein levels in tissue of 24 patients with NSCLC treated with perioperative nivolumab plus chemotherapy from NADIM trial (NCT03081689). We integrated HLA tumor status with molecular data (programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), TMB, TCR repertoire, TILs populations, bulk RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (ST)) and clinical outcomes (pathological response and survival data) to study the activity of perioperative ChIO considering HLA class I defects. HLA-DEF tumors comprised 41.7% of analyzed tumors and showed a desert-like microenvironment at baseline, with lower PD-L1 levels and reduced immune infiltrate. However, perioperative ChIO induced similar complete pathological response (CPR) rates in both HLA-DEF and PRO tumors (50% and 60% respectively, p=0.670), as well as 3-year survival rates: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 70% (95% CI 32.9% to 89.2%) for HLA-DEF, and PFS 71.4% (95% CI 40.6% to 88.2%) and OS 92.9% (95% CI 59.1% to 99.0%) for HLA-PRO (log-rank PFS p=0.909, OS p=0.137). Proof-of-concept ST analysis of a CPR HLA-DEF tumor after ChIO showed a strong immune response with tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), CD4+T cells with HLA class II colocalization, and activated CD8+T cells. Our findings highlight the activity of perioperative ChIO, and the potential role of TLS and T-cell immune response, in NSCLC HLA-DEF tumors.
