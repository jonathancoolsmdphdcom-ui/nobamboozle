Cellular plasticity and non-small cell lung cancer: role of T and NK cell immune evasion and acquisition of resistance to immunotherapies.

Lung cancer is a leading global cause of mortality, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for a significant portion of cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed NSCLC treatment; however, many patients remain unresponsive. ICI resistance in NSCLC and its association with cellular plasticity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhanced adaptability, invasiveness, and resistance is largely influenced by epigenetic changes, signaling pathways, tumor microenvironment, and associated immune cells, fibroblasts, and cytokines. Immunosuppressive cells, including M2 tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells, contribute to resistance by suppressing the immune response. This cellular plasticity is influenced when B cells, natural killer cells, and T cells are exhausted or inhibited by components of the tumor microenvironment. Conversely, diverse T cell, NK cell, and B cell subsets hold potential as predictive response markers particularly cytotoxic CD8
