Chronic inflammation drives epididymal tertiary lymphoid structure formation and autoimmune fertility disorders.

The incomplete understanding of epididymal mucosal immunity is a significant contributing factor to the classification of many male infertility cases as idiopathic. Conditions that disrupt the immune balance in the male reproductive tract, such as vasectomy and infections, can expose sperm to the immune system, leading to increased production of anti-sperm antibodies (ASAs) and subsequent reproductive challenges. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate inflammation and maintain sperm tolerance. In a murine model, we demonstrated that disrupting sperm immunotolerance induces chronic autoimmune responses characterized by antibody production targeting sperm and reproductive tissue autoantigens and unique tissue-specific immune cell signatures in the epididymis and testis. Such inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive sustained male subfertility. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed within the epididymis after Treg depletion, defined by clusters of heterogenous B and T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These ectopic structures perpetuate inflammation and lower the activation threshold for future immune threats. Similar isotypes of autoantibodies were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting shared mechanistic pathways between mice and humans. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse B- and T-cell dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for infertility and chronic inflammation. Additionally, this immunological characterization of the epididymal microenvironment has the potential to identify novel targets for the development of male contraceptives. Understanding the epididymal immune cell landscape dynamics aids in developing targeted therapies for infertility and contraception.
