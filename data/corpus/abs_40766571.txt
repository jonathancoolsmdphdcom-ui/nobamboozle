Thioredoxin Reductase 1 inhibition triggers ferroptosis in KRAS-independent lung cancers.

Lung cancers that harbor wild type KRAS (KRAS-WT) represent a molecularly diverse subset of tumors that often lack targeted therapeutic options. Using synthesized gold(I)-based inhibitors, a multi-omics approach, and functional validation, we identified Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), encoding as a selective vulnerability in KRAS-WT and oncogenic KRAS mutant (KM)-independent lung cancer (LC). Mechanistically, TRXR1 blockade induces ferroptosis through glutathione depletion, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and HMOX1-dependent iron overload in KRAS-WT LC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, while KM LC cells are intrinsically resistant to TRXR1 inhibition, KMLC cells that acquire resistance to KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) undergo a redox shift that renders them sensitive to TRXR1 inhibition, uncovering a potential novel therapeutic vulnerability in KRASi-refractory tumors. These findings establish TRXR1 as a targetable redox checkpoint in KRAS-WT and KRASi-resistant lung cancers and support further development of TRXR1 inhibitors.
