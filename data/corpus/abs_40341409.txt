Tertiary lymphoid structures in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Review).

The tumor microenvironment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a critical role in tumor progression and prognosis. The organization of T cells, B cells and high‑endothelial venules into structures termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), are associated with favorable outcomes in HNSCC. Despite their importance, the formation and function of TLS‑associated immune cells in HNSCC have remained elusive. The aim of the present review is to elucidate the mechanism underlying TLS formation, which may contribute to the development of novel and effective immunotherapies for HNSCC, and summarize recent advances in HNSCC treatment.
